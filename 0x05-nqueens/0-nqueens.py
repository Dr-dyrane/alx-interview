N Queens Solver

This script aims to solve the N Queens puzzle,
a classic chess problem where the challenge
is to place N non-attacking queens on an NÃ—N chessboard.

Usage: ./0-nqueens.py N

- N must be an integer greater or equal to 4.
- If the user provides the wrong number of arguments,
    the program prints 'Usage: nqueens N'
  and exits with status 1.
- If N is not an integer, the program prints
    'N must be a number' and exits with status 1.
- If N is smaller than 4, the program prints
    'N must be at least 4' and exits with status 1.

The program prints every possible solution to the N Queens problem,
one solution per line.
