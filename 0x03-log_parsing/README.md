## Introduction

ðŸš€ Welcome to the Log Parsing project! This project is designed to provide a script for parsing log data, computing metrics, and displaying statistics based on defined requirements.

## Project Overview

The Log Parsing project consists of a Python script (`0-stats.py`) that reads log data from standard input and computes various metrics. The input log data is generated using the `0-generator.py` script. The project aims to demonstrate proficiency in Python programming, log parsing, and data analysis.

## Installation

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the GitHub repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dr-dyrane/alx-interview.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd alx-interview/0x03-log_parsing
   ```

3. Run the log data generator:

   ```bash
   ./0-generator.py | ./0-stats.py
   ```

## Usage

The main script, `0-stats.py`, reads log data line by line, computes metrics, and prints statistics based on specified conditions. The log data is generated by `0-generator.py` and serves as input for analysis.

```bash
./0-generator.py | ./0-stats.py
```

## Project Structure

The project directory structure is as follows:

```
alx-interview/
â””â”€â”€ 0x03-log_parsing/
    â”œâ”€â”€ 0-generator.py
    â””â”€â”€ 0-stats.py
```

## Implementation Details

The implementation of the log parsing script is based on the following logic:

- The script reads log data line by line from standard input.
- For every 10 lines or a keyboard interruption (CTRL + C), it prints the following statistics:
  - Total file size.
  - Number of lines for each status code (200, 301, 400, 401, 403, 404, 405, 500).

The code is designed to be modular, DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), well-documented, and easy to understand. It adheres to PEP 8 style guidelines and includes error handling for unexpected input.

For a detailed explanation of the logic, refer to the inline comments in the `0-stats.py` script.
