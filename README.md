## Introduction

The ALX Interview Preparation Repository is a comprehensive resource for those preparing for technical interviews in software development. It covers a range of topics, including algorithms, data structures, and specific coding challenges.

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized into directories, each corresponding to a specific coding challenge or topic. Here are some of the main directories:

- `0x00-pascal_triangle`: Pascal's Triangle coding challenge.
- `0x01-lockboxes`: Lockboxes coding challenge.
- `0x02-minimum_operations`: Minimum Operations coding challenge.
- ... (and so on for each challenge)

Each challenge directory contains a solution script (e.g., `0-pascal_triangle.py`) and a main script demonstrating its usage (e.g., `0-main.py`).

## Getting Started

To explore a specific coding challenge, navigate to its directory and review the associated files. The README within each challenge directory may provide additional details and instructions.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have a new coding challenge, improvement, or additional content, follow the contributing guidelines outlined in each challenge directory.
