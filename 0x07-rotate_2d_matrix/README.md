# Rotate 2D Matrix

## Overview

This project is aimed at implementing a function to rotate an n x n 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise in-place. The task involves writing a Python function adhering to specific requirements and constraints outlined in the provided prompt.

## Repository Structure

The project repository follows the standard structure:

```
alx-interview/
|-- 0x07-rotate_2d_matrix/
|   |-- 0-rotate_2d_matrix.py
|   |-- main_0.py
|   |-- README.md
```

- `0x07-rotate_2d_matrix/`: The main project directory.
- `0-rotate_2d_matrix.py`: The Python script containing the implementation of the `rotate_2d_matrix` function.
- `main_0.py`: A test script to demonstrate the usage of the implemented function.
- `README.md`: This README file containing detailed information about the project.

## Project Details

### Task Description

The primary task is to implement a function called `rotate_2d_matrix` that takes an n x n 2D matrix as input and rotates it 90 degrees clockwise in-place.

### Function Prototype

```python
def rotate_2d_matrix(matrix):
    """Rotates a given n x n 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise in-place."""
    # Implementation details go here
```

### Test Script

The `main_0.py` script is provided for testing the implementation. It creates a sample matrix, calls the `rotate_2d_matrix` function, and prints the rotated matrix.

### Constraints and Requirements

- The implementation should not import any modules.
- Code should adhere to the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.8.0).
- All files should be executable.
- Documentation for all modules and functions is mandatory.

## Execution

To run the provided test script:

```bash
./main_0.py
```

This will output the rotated matrix based on the provided example.
